    <h1>Pizza</h1>

   <figcaption>Some days I really wish I was one of “those people” who genuinely craves fresh vegetables over cheese and carbs. It’s not that I hate vegetables, I don’t at all! It’s just……well, you know. Put a piping hot garlic cheese pizza in front of me, in all its magnificent melty cheesy glory, alongside the best salad in the world, and there’s just no question what I’m going for, every single time:</figcaption>
 
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Garlic</b> – Fresh, and only fresh! Garlic pasties jars and tubes have an unpleasant sourness to them due to the preservatives. There is no substitution for the real thing!</li>
    <li><b>Mozzarella</b> cheese – For melting perfection and lovely brown golden spots on the surface. Also, mozzarella is not oily like other cheeses.</li>
    <li><b>Parmesan</b> – This adds flavour, because parmesan is loaded with savoury flavour and is salty.</li>
    <li><b>Olive oil</b> – Mixed with the garlic to spread on the pizza base.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
    <li>Steep oil with garlic – Mix the oil and garlic and set aside for 10 minutes to infuse with flavour.</li>
    <li>Stretch your chosen pizza base onto a pizza pan, preferably one with holes in it (crispy base!).</li>
    <li>Spread the garlic infused oil over the base.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with parmesan then mozzarella, leaving a border around the crust (for gripping purposes).</li>
    <p1>Note: If you are using my no-yeast pizza base, spray or brush the exposed edge with olive oil so it browns. You don’t need to do this for yeast-based pizza dough.</p1>
    <li>Bake for 8 minutes in a hot 250°C / 480°F (230°C fan) oven, rotating the tray halfway, until you have lovely golden spots on the cheese.</li>
    <li><b>Cut and Eat</b></li>
</ol>
