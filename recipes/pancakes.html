    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Flour:</strong>This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li> <strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li> <strong> Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty. </li>
        <li> <strong>Milk and butter:</strong> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Egg:</strong> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.  </li>
